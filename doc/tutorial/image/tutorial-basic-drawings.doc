\section image_display_intro Introduction

In this tutorial you will learn how to draw basic drawings with ViSP either on Unix-like systems (including OSX, Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian, ...) or on Windows.

Note that all the material (source code and images) described in this tutorial is part of ViSP source code and could be downloaded using the following command:

\code
$ svn export https://github.com/lagadic/visp.git/trunk/tutorial/image
\endcode

\section image_display_default How to display an image

ViSP <a href="https://visp.inria.fr/gui/">gui module</a> provides Graphical User Interfaces capabilities. This module may use several optional third-party libraries which are: <a href="http://visp.inria.fr/3rdparty_gui/">OpenCV, X11, GTK, GDI, Direct3D</a>. We recommand to use X11 on unix-like systems thanks to vpDisplayX class and GDI on Windows thanks to vpDisplayGDI. 

The following example also available in tutorial-image-display.cpp shows how to create a gray level 3840x2160 image with all the pixels set to 128, and display a red circle with 200 pixel radius in the middle of the image. 

\include tutorial-viewer.cpp

Here is the detailed explanation of the source, line by line :
\snippet tutorial-viewer.cpp Include display

Include all the headers for image viewers. The two first one are for Windows systems. They require that Direct 3D or the \e Graphical \e Device \e Interface (\e GDI) coming with the installation of Visual Studio are available. The third one needs GTK that is cross-platform. The fourth is for unix-like systems and requires that \e libX11 is available. The last one is also cross-platform and requires that OpenCV is available. 

\snippet tutorial-viewer.cpp Include io
Include the header that allows to read/write PGM, PPM, PNG and JPEG images from the disk using vpImageIo class.

\snippet tutorial-viewer.cpp vpImage construction
Create an instance of a color image where each pixel is coded in RGBa.

\snippet tutorial-viewer.cpp vpImage reading
The image \c I is initialized by reading an image file from the disk. If the image format is not supported we throw an exception.

\snippet tutorial-viewer.cpp vpDisplay construction
Create an instance of an image display window for image \c I. The first viewer that is available is used. Here we create the link between the image \c I and the display \c d. Note that an image can only have one display. 

\snippet tutorial-viewer.cpp vpDisplay set title
The title of the display is then set to \c "My image".  

\snippet tutorial-viewer.cpp vpDisplay display
First we display the content of the image \c I, then we flush the display to render the image.

\snippet tutorial-viewer.cpp vpDisplay get click
Here we handle mouse events. We are waiting for a blocking mouse click to end the program.

Here is a screen shot of the resulting output window :

\section basic_drawings How to draw basic drawings

\subsection point How to draw a point

We use displayPoint function of vpDisplay class to draw a point on the screen.

\include tutorial-draw-point.cpp

Here we draw a point at the center of a grey image with red color and thickness 2.

\subsection line How to draw a line segment

We use displayLine function of vpDisplay class to draw a line segment on the screen.

\snippet tutorial-draw-line.cpp Line

Here we draw a red coloured line segment with the specified initial and final coordinates and thickness 10.

\subsection circle How to draw a circle

We use displayCircle function of vpDisplay class to draw a circle on the screen.

\snippet tutorial-image-display-scaled-auto.cpp Circle

Here we draw a red coloured filled circle at the center with radius of 200.

\subsection rectangle How to draw a rectangle

We use displayRectangle function of vpDisplay class to draw a rectangle on the screen.

\snippet tutorial-draw-rectangle.cpp Rectangle

Here we draw a red coloured filled rectangle with specified top-left coordinates and width and height.

\subsection cross How to draw a cross

We use displayCross function of vpDisplay class to draw a rectangle on the screen.

\snippet tutorial-draw-cross.cpp Cross

Here we draw a red coloured corss on the center with speicfied size and thickness 2.

\section adding_text How to add text in the window overlay

We use displayCharString of vpDisplay class to add text in the window overlay.

\include tutorial-draw-text.cpp

\section adding_text How to export an image

We use getImage of vpDisplay class to update the image with an overlay. 

\include tutorial-export-image.cpp

\section event_keyboard How to handle keyboard events

We use getKeyboardEvent of vpDisplay class to get the value of the key pressed.

\include tutorial-event-keyboard.cpp
