\section bebop2_intro Introduction

This tutorial explains how to do image-based servoing with a Parrot Bebop 2 drone.

\image html img-bebop2.jpg

The following material is necessary:
- Parrot Bebop 2 drone
- An AprilTag from 36h11 family that will serve as target for the visual servoing. \ref franka_prereq_target. 

ViSP must be built with OpenCV and Parrot ARSDK3 support.

\note Before continuing, we recommend that you succeed to complete \ref tutorial-detection-apriltag.

\section bebop2_ibvs Image-based visual-servoing 
\subsection mbot_run_ibvs Running the program

The next step is now to run the image-based visual servoing example implemented in servoBebop2.cpp. 
\n In this example, we use three visual features for the servoing :
- Image moment for normalized gravity center implemented in vpFeatureMomentGravityCenterNormalized, to center the drone along X and Y axes in front of the tag.
- Image moment for normalized area implemented in vpFeatureMomentAreaNormalized to control the distance between the drone and the tag.
- Horizontal vanishing points from the top and bottom tag sides implemented in vpFeatureVanishingPoint, to change the orientation of the drone based on the tag orientation.

\note  Before starting the program, the drone should be turned on and the computer connected to the drone WiFi.

If you built ViSP with OpenCV and Parrot ARSDK3 support, the corresponding binary is available in `/home/[...]/visp-ws/visp-build/example/servo-bebop2/`.

    $ cd /home/[...]/visp-ws/visp-build/example/servo-bebop2
    $ ./servoBebop2 --tag_size 0.14

\note Passing the tag size (in meters) as a parameter is required.

Run `./servoBebop2 --help` to see which are the command line options available.
- Adding option `--distance_to_tag 1.5` allows to specify the desired distance (in meters) to the tag for the drone servoing. Values between 0.5 and 2 are recommended.
- Adding option `--intrinsic ~/path-to-calibration-file/camera.xml` allows you to specify the intrinsic camera calibration parameters. This file can be obtained by completing \ref tutorial-calibration-intrinsic.
